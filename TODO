- style:
    The app has no style apart from what I think is necessary for usability.
- put some default maze:
    Sometimes, while testing the app, 
    I'd have liked to have some default pattern/maze to paste on the grid. 
    A good idea might be to add a panel with some default pattern/maze to choose from,
    and when clicked they are drawn on the grid.
- add a new algo:
    I left the skeleton on how to add new algos.
